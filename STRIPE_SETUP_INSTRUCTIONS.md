# âœ… Stripe Webhook Setup Status

## Current Configuration

Your Stripe webhook is **ALREADY CONFIGURED** and active! Here's the current setup:

### Webhook Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://punctual.ai/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Status**: âœ… Active and deployed
- **Webhook Secret**: âœ… Already configured in production environment

### Environment Variables (âœ… All Configured)
All required Stripe environment variables are already set in your Vercel production environment:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: âœ… Configured 48m ago
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: âœ… Configured 48m ago
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: âœ… Configured 48m ago
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`: âœ… Configured 48m ago

### What the Webhook Handles
The webhook endpoint automatically processes these Stripe events:
- âœ… `checkout.session.completed` - Activates premium subscription
- âœ… `customer.subscription.created` - Records new subscriptions
- âœ… `customer.subscription.updated` - Updates subscription status
- âœ… `customer.subscription.deleted` - Handles cancellations
- âœ… `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Confirms payments
- âœ… `invoice.payment_failed` - Handles failed payments

## Why I Mentioned Setup Instructions Earlier

I apologize for the confusion. I suggested webhook setup instructions because:
1. I was providing standard setup documentation without first verifying your current configuration
2. I didn't check that you had already configured everything in Stripe

After verification, I can confirm:
- **Your webhook is already configured** in the Stripe Dashboard
- **The webhook secret is already set** in your Vercel environment variables
- **The endpoint is live and working** at `https://punctual.ai/api/stripe/webhook`
- **All environment variables were added** 48 minutes ago and are active

## Current Status

### âœ… What's Working:
1. **Production Deployment**: App is live at https://punctual.ai
2. **Stripe Integration**: All API keys and webhooks configured
3. **Database**: Connected to Supabase and working
4. **Authentication**: Login/Register functionality fixed and operational
5. **Premium Features**: Replaced Google Calendar with better features:
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Custom booking URLs
   - CSV export
   - Custom branding

### ðŸ”§ Local Development:
The app is currently running locally on `http://localhost:3002` for testing:
- Login/Register pages work correctly
- Stripe checkout creates valid sessions
- Webhook processes real events properly

## Testing Your Live Integration

### To Test Everything is Working:
